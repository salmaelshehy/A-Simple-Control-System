1-a)Brushed : has permanent magnets inside its outer body with a rotating armature inside. The permanent magnets are stationary and are called the 'stator'.
The rotating armature contains an electromagnet and is called the 'rotor'.the rotor spins 180-degrees when an electric current is applied to the armature. 
Low cost: Brushed DC motors are relatively inexpensive to produce and purchase compared to brushless DC motors. 
Suited to industrial environments: Due to their high starting torque. Due to the effects of friction on a motor’s carbon brushes, they will naturally wear over time. 
As a result, brushed electric motors are more likely to require some sort of maintenance in the form of brush cleaning or replacement.
b)Brushless : Eliminates the need for brushes. In a brushless DC motor, the permanent magnets are fitted to the rotor, with the electromagnets on the stator.
An electronic speed controller (ESC) regulates or ‘commutates’ the charge to the electromagnets in the stator, to enable the rotor to travel through 360-degrees. 
Brushless DC motors don’t have brushes, which means they require less maintenance than their brushed counterparts. 
The lack of brushes means that no speed is lost, making brushless DC motors a little more efficient, typically 85-90% compared with their brushed counterparts at a typical 75-80% efficiency.
Brushless DC motors need to be wired to an electronic speed control (ESC), to enable current to flow to the electromagnets.Due to the requirement for a controller, brushless DC motors can be more expensive.

2-a)Motor encoder : sensor attached to motor shaft to provide a feedback on speed , direction & position (when you need an accurate feedback).
b)servo : motor with feedback system to control position and speed.
c)stepper : moves in dsecrete steps (motor with step control).

3-UART: Simple, 2 wires, one-to-one communication, moderate speed.
I2C: 2 wires, supports many devices, slower, good for sensors.
SPI: 4 wires, very fast, supports multiple devices, more complex wiring.
